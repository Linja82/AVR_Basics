# Arduino Basics
Some basic pieces of Arduino code for various sensors/devices that I commonly use.

## Arduino to Python (Bluetooth)
This set of code allows you to transmit data from an HC-05 Bluetooth module to Python. The intended setup is from an Arduino to a PC.

## PC_Fan_Control
Make PC fans go brrr at whatever speed you want. 

As far as I know it only works on Seeeduino XIAO SAMD21 ÂµControllers. Probably won't work on regular Arduinos.

## Positional_Servo
Allows you to control a servo motor by sending angle values through the serial port. Sending a value of "-1" returns the servo to 0 degrees.
