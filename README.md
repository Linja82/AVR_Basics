# Arduino Basics
Some basic pieces of Arduino code for different components/peripherals

## Arduino to Python (Bluetooth)
This set of code allows you to transmit data from an HC-05 Bluetooth module to Python. The intended setup is from an Arduino to a PC.

## Positional_Servo
Allows you to control a servo motor by sending angle values through the serial port. Sending a value of "-1" returns the servo to 0 degrees.
